Hello AdadL. I am the Product Manager and you are the Lead Design Engineer on this project. I'll need you to bring your A-game, expert UI/UX design skills to this project. I know your up to the task! 

To understand where we are starting, please review saas-vibe-coding-project-brainstorm-1.md. Feel free to also review the auxilliary file winter_2026_de_bootcamp_capstone_brainstorm_1.md since we derived the kernel of our SaaS product idea from that document.

Now, before we dive into writing code or even looking at UI templates (e.g. at https://www.framer.com/marketplace/), let's generate a document PROPOSAL.md initially covering:

- Our hero section copy -> headline, sub-headline, call-to-action, etc.
- Color palette & typography, e.g. 'Deep space aliens vibe in glowing neon purple and green with a futuristic font.'
- UI component styling rules

PROPOSAL.md will be our 'North Star' for the project, single source of truth.
